        <p id="Info-About-Us">Donatr was created to serve as a bridge between the more privileged and the less privileged around the world. In today’s society, there is an availability of tools to help raise awareness and solve humanitarian issues, tools that weren’t present decades ago. The internet and social media, for example, have come a long way in bridging the gap between privileged and non privileged people around the world in different ways and forms. Although society has come a long way in our journey to a unified and socially aware world, we still have quite a path ahead of us. Donatr is here to help further that path significantly.

          <h3>Our Misson</h3>
          <p class = "info-para">Our mission is to connect individuals anywhere in the world to NGOs and charities either in their country or any other country they wish to aid, with a simple click of a button. We aim to raise awareness for socially, economically and physically disadvantaged people and societies around the world by running our product, Donatr, which not only raises awareness of these NGOs and charities, but enables users to read up on what each charity is about and link them to each NGO site where they can go ahead and donate to a cause of their choosing. Our platform brings society one step closer to our ultimate goal which is global unity and social awareness. </p>
        </section>
        <section class = "info" id = "vision">
          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p class = "info-para">Our vision is to inspire global unity and raise awareness for communities and individuals suffering from all sorts of crises around the world. we aim to connect a wide range of NGOs to donors not only so it becomes easier for those NGOs to reach their goals but so that anyone anywhere can take part aiding those that need help with a simple click of a button. Distance or disparities in language or culture should not be a barrier in the journey to global unity. This is our philosophy at Donatr.</p>

        <section class = "info" id = "promise">
          <h3>Our Promise</h3>
          <p class = "info-para" >Our promise is to serve the community effeciently and adequately by informing you on pressing issues and linking you to trustworthy and legitimate charities. We want you to be part of the change. Furthermore, we hope to raise awareness on various humanitarian crises as we believe that there must be an online platform that allows for people to educate themselves on these topics. Overall, we promise that as an organization we will strive to end humanitarian crises while also encouraging the youth to make a difference in ways that go beyond monetary support. </p>
